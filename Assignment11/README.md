## 🎯 Questions

### 1. Prime Number Check
Write a program which accepts one number and checks whether it is prime or not.

**Example:**
```
Input: 11
Output: Prime Number
```
**Definition:** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

---

### 2. Count of Digits
Write a program which accepts one number and prints count of digits in that number.

**Example:**
```
Input: 7521
Output: 4
```

---

### 3. Sum of Digits
Write a program which accepts one number and prints sum of digits.

**Example:**
```
Input: 123
Output: 6
```
**Explanation:** 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

---

### 4. Reverse Number
Write a program which accepts one number and prints reverse of that number.

**Example:**
```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```

---

### 5. Palindrome Check
Write a program which accepts one number and checks whether it is palindrome or not.

**Example:**
```
Input: 121
Output: Palindrome
```
**Definition:** A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.
