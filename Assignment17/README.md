## 🎯 Questions

### 1. Arithmetic Module
Create one module named as `Arithmetic` which contains 4 functions as `Add()` for addition, `Sub()` for subtraction, `Mult()` for multiplication and `Div()` for division. All functions accept two parameters as numbers and perform the operation. Write a Python program which calls all the functions from Arithmetic module by accepting the parameters from user.

**Example:**
```
Enter first number: 21
Enter second number: 11

Output:
21 + 11 = 32
21 - 11 = 10
21 * 11 = 231
21 / 11 = 1.909...
```

---

### 2. Square Pattern
Write a program which accepts one number from user and displays below pattern.

**Example:**
```
Input: 5

Output:
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
```

---

### 3. Factorial
Write a program which accepts one number from user and returns its factorial.

**Example:**
```
Input: 5
Output: 120
```
**Explanation:** 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

---

### 4. Sum of Factors
Write a program which accepts one number from user and returns addition of its factors.

**Example:**
```
Input: 12
Output: 16
```
**Explanation:** Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16

---

### 5. Prime Number Check
Write a program which accepts one number from user and checks whether the number is prime or not.

**Example:**
```
Input: 11
Output: It is Prime Number

Input: 12
Output: It is not Prime Number
```

---

### 6. Right Triangle Pattern (Decreasing)
Write a program which accepts one number and displays below pattern.

**Example:**
```
Input: 5

Output:
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
* 
```

---

### 7. Number Pattern (Rectangular)
Write a program which accepts one number and displays below pattern.

**Example:**
```
Input: 5

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

---

### 8. Number Triangle Pattern (Increasing)
Write a program which accepts one number and displays below pattern.

**Example:**
```
Input: 5

Output:
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

---

### 9. Count of Digits
Write a program which accepts a number from user and returns the number of digits in that number.

**Example:**
```
Input: 5187934
Output: 7
```

---

### 10. Sum of Digits
Write a program which accepts a number from user and returns addition of digits in that number.

**Example:**
```
Input: 5187934
Output: 37
```
**Explanation:** 5 + 1 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 3 + 4 = 37
