## 🎯 Questions

### 1. Square Numbers Using map()
Write a lambda function using `map()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns a list of squares of each number.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

---

### 2. Filter Even Numbers
Write a lambda function using `filter()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns a list of even numbers.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

---

### 3. Filter Odd Numbers
Write a lambda function using `filter()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns a list of odd numbers.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]
```

---

### 4. Sum of All Elements Using reduce()
Write a lambda function using `reduce()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns the addition of all elements.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 15
```

---

### 5. Maximum Element Using reduce()
Write a lambda function using `reduce()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns the maximum element.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [5, 12, 3, 25, 8]
Output: 25
```

---

### 6. Minimum Element Using reduce()
Write a lambda function using `reduce()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns the minimum element.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [5, 12, 3, 25, 8]
Output: 3
```

---

### 7. Filter Strings by Length
Write a lambda function using `filter()` which accepts a list of strings and returns a list of strings having length greater than 5.

**Example:**
```python
Input: ["apple", "banana", "cat", "dog", "elephant"]
Output: ["banana", "elephant"]
```

---

### 8. Filter Numbers Divisible by 3 and 5
Write a lambda function using `filter()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns a list of numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [15, 30, 10, 45, 20, 60]
Output: [15, 30, 45, 60]
```

---

### 9. Product of All Elements Using reduce()
Write a lambda function using `reduce()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns the product of all elements.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [2, 3, 4]
Output: 24
```

---

### 10. Count Even Numbers
Write a lambda function using `filter()` which accepts a list of numbers and returns the count of even numbers.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: 5
```
