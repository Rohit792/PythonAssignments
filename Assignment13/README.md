## 🎯 Questions

### 1. Area of Rectangle
Write a program which accepts length and width of rectangle and prints area.

**Formula:** Area = Length × Width

**Example:**
```
Input: Length = 5, Width = 3
Output: Area = 15
```

---

### 2. Area of Circle
Write a program which accepts radius of circle and prints area of circle.

**Formula:** Area = π × r²

**Example:**
```
Input: Radius = 7
Output: Area = 153.94 (approximately)
```
**Note:** Use `math.pi` or 3.14159 for π

---

### 3. Perfect Number Check
Write a program which accepts one number and checks whether it is perfect number or not.

**Example:**
```
Input: 6
Output: Perfect Number
```
**Definition:** A perfect number is a positive integer that equals the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).
**Explanation:** 6 = 1 + 2 + 3

---

### 4. Decimal to Binary Conversion
Write a program which accepts one number and prints binary equivalent.

**Example:**
```
Input: 10
Output: 1010
```

---

### 5. Grade Calculator
Write a program which accepts marks and displays grade.

**Grading System:**
- ≥ 75 → Distinction
- ≥ 60 → First Class
- ≥ 50 → Second Class
- < 50 → Fail

**Example:**
```
Input: 82
Output: Distinction
```
