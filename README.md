## 📋 Core Concepts Covered

These assignments focus on fundamental Python programming concepts including:

- **Functions**: Creation, parameters, and return values
- **User Input Handling**: `input()` function and type conversion
- **Conditional Logic**: `if-else` statements and logical operators
- **Mathematical Operations**: Arithmetic, exponentiation, modulo
- **Loops**: `for` and `while` loops for iteration
- **String Operations**: Character checking, manipulation
- **Number Theory**: Prime numbers, palindromes, factorials
- **Data Validation**: Input checking and error handling

## 📝 Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, you will understand:

1. **Function Definition and Invocation** - How to create and call functions with and without parameters
2. **User Input Handling** - How to accept and process user input using `input()` and type conversion
3. **Comparison Operations** - Using comparison operators to evaluate relationships between values
4. **Mathematical Operations** - Performing calculations using operators like `**` (exponentiation) and `%` (modulo)
5. **Conditional Logic** - Making decisions in code using `if` statements and logical operators
6. **Code Organization** - Structuring programs with proper function separation and `main()` function
