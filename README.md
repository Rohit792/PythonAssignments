- **Mathematical Operations**: Arithmetic, exponentiation, modulo
- **Loops**: `for` and `while` loops for iteration
- **String Operations**: Character checking, manipulation
- **Number Theory**: Prime numbers, palindromes, factorials
- **Data Validation**: Input checking and error handling
- **Lambda Functions**: Anonymous functions for concise operations
- **Functional Programming**: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()` functions
- **Modules**: Creating and importing custom modules
- **Lists**: Operations, transformations, and manipulations
- **Multithreading**: Thread creation, execution, and management
- **Thread Synchronization**: Locks, shared resources, race condition prevention
- **Concurrent Programming**: Running multiple threads simultaneously
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, instance and class variables
